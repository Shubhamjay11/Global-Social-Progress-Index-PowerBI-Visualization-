# Global-Social-Progress-Index ( PowerBI-Visualization )
Here we are going to visualise the Global Social Progress Index with the help of PowerBI, and then we will find answers to various questions.

# Social Progress Index (SPI)
The Social Progress Index (SPI) measures the extent to which countries provide for the social and environmental needs of their citizens. The index is based on 54 indicators in the areas of basic human needs, foundations of well-being, and opportunity to progress, which show the relative performance of nations.

## Data Description
The SPI measures the well-being of a society by observing social and environmental outcomes directly rather than the economic factors. The social and environmental factors include wellness (including health, shelter, and sanitation), equality, inclusion, sustainability, and personal freedom and safety.

### The dataset contains information about the following columns:

'spi_rank': rank of the country   
'country': name of the country   
'spi_score': social progress score   
'basic_human_needs': basic human needs   
'wellbeing': foundations of wellbeing   
'opportunity': opportunity  
'basic_nutri_med_care': nutritional and basic medical care   
'water_sanitation': water and sanitation      
'shelter': shelter   
'personal_safety': personal safety  
'access_basic_knowledge': access to basic knowledge   
'access_info_comms': access to information and communication   
'health_wellness': health and wellness   
'env_quality': environment quality   
'personal_rights': personal rights   
'personal_freedom_choice': personal freedom and choice   
'inclusiveness': inclusiveness   
'access_adv_edu': access to advanced education


## Analysis
Using this dataset, we can answer a number of questions about the social progress of countries around the world. Some potential analyses include:

1) Creating a dashboard of major findings and conclusions from the SPI report dataset.
2) Identifying the top 3 biggest areas of underperformance in the world.
3) Identifying the top 3 biggest areas of improvement in the world.
4) Comparing the health and education indicators of two countries of your choice among the top 5 countries.
5) Visualizing the performance of a chosen country, highlighting where the country performed well and where it needs improvement.
6) Determining the major contributors to a country's SPI score.
7) Examining the weightages of each component in calculating the SPI score.
8) Considering which components would be major contributors to the SPI score of a new country in the South American continent and which components would need special attention.
8) Analyzing the impact of COVID-19 on the SPI scores.
9) Assessing the potential impact of a war between an Asian and a European country on the global SPI score.
10) Identifying which global issues must be addressed as the highest priority according to the SPI score and why.

The SPI dataset is a powerful tool for understanding the social progress of countries around the world and identifying areas for improvement. By answering these questions, we can gain a deeper understanding of the social and environmental needs of citizens and work towards creating a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
